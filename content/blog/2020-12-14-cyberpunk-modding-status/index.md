Hey Choomba!
I'm the Community Manager of the "CP77 Modding Community" Discord and wanted to give y'all an update and status regarding modding for the game.

Cyberpunk has been released 4 days ago, and we the community have been working day and night on reverse engineering the engine. With every day, we are getting closer to release the first mod manager and to be able to load mods without changing the files directly. The discord is currently with a lot of members who have created "WolvenKit", the modding kit for W3 and CDPR staff who are watching us. We all are working together to create tools and mods for everyone.

Modding status:
The current status of a mod manager is unclear, but not far away. Thanks to Avery3R to figuring out a way to use the already build in console, we have managed to archive a huge milestone. While working on a mod manager we are also working of various tool to help modders. A huge part we are working on are getting all those hashes for game files and working on textures and model extraction.


Until then cheers,
Your RED Modding Team
