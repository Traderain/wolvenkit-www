Hey Choombas!

Welcome to the first weekly update post from us at the CP77 Modding Tools Server.It has been barley 3 Days since the first post regarding modding. And we have to say, we have come even closer to be able to mod the game! Every day we are working day and night to make modding possible and currently we are working on big topics. We started working on our Mod Manager! But how that'll effects anyone, later in this post.

As you now, we are working on reverse engineering the REDengine 4 and with that to understand and be able to tell the game to load and use our own custom and customized .archive files. But to be able to load them, we are working on a Mod manager, that not only loads the mod but gives a nice and clean GUI for everyone, starter or come back modders!

Mod Manager

How is it going to work?The mod manager is going to be separated into 2 main parts.

1. the GUI, a interface for everyone to work with. Here you go and look for mods online and install them manually, or via our own Mod site. (We have not been in touch with nexus mods yet, but we looking for a way, to maybe integrate them!) With our easy GUI design even those who never modded can install new mods easily with just a press of a button. We are currently working on the design itself, with having a prototype, leaning on RapidDevs ModManager design from nexus. ! THE MOD MANAGER ON NEXUS IS NOT BY US !

2. The GPM or Game Package Manager is a CLI for mod management, responsible for installing, building, publishing and downloading mod packages. It's basically the backbone, and what we are going to use to mods the game with.



We are currently doing so much at a time, that it ain't even possible for us to list it here, so if you caught some interest feel free to join our Discord and interact with more than 4,5k people who are interested in modding or help us out in various topics that range from reverse engineering on memory level, or helping to get a hang of models and texture! We are welcoming everyone!

Until then cheers,Your CP77 Modding Tools team!
