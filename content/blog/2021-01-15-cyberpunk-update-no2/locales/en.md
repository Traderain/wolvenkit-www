Hey Choombas!

The time has come and a new update have to be posted. Last time I've posted about the internally developed MM but today will be different! We now have had a bit more time between the last post and this one and this is regarding holidays and people who got ill. But with start 2021 development of tools come and take a new turn. We as well came into contact with CDPR, but about that later in this post.

Our current progress can be viewed as following in 2 main topics: Scripted Modding and Content Modding.

1. Scripted Modding:With CET ( Cyber Engine Tweaks ) out console enabler and script library we have made the first step into creating a framework for the community to create mods by their own. With Lua you can make scripts and load them during gameplay or at the start of the game. We are actively developing and dropping debug versions of the tool in our for test of upcoming changes for Modders. During the time we have made big jumps in development and added a lot of new content and stuff to the Mod to make new good mods for everyone! A big thank you for Yamashi to initially creating the Mod and WhySoSerious to being on of the most active in developing and improving the Mod.Examples:- CET Ingame Mod Manager by Natsji at nexus- CYBER H4CK by specikk at nexus- Vehicle Unlocker by specikk at nexus


2. Content Modding:With the WolvenKit creators ( who have initially initiated the project of Modding CP77 ) we are coming closer and closer to being able to fully port / add functionality to Mod Cyberpunk 2077 with WolvenKit and add new content as well as edit existing one! But until this is done we have our CLI based tool called "CP77Tools" (original I know :D ) that is allowing us unpack and pack( !experiment! ) .archive files to allow edits of files and look at them directly. It even has more functions, but for more info join our discord or take a look the github respo. A big thank your for rfuzzo to make the CP77Tools and the both rfuzzo and Traderain for WolvenKit and the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 Support!


With a lot of notice thanks to users on the Discord, I have noticed to forgot to add a specific tool developed by WopsS: RED4ext!

RED4ext is a library that extends REDengine 4. It will allow modders to add new features, modify the game behavior, add new scripting functions or call existing ones in your own plugins.

This library is similar to Script Hook V. A BIG thank you to you WopsS and Yamashi!


Now about the contact with CDPR. CDPR has been going through a lot of stuff lately with Cyberpunk 2077 and they have come to see that involving us as the community is a good idea. We at the CP77 Modding Tools team are working on open source tools for everyone to extend the lifetime of the game and quality. We are thus honoured to have heard from CDPR openly encouraging the modding community and wanting to add mod support. But until now we haven't heard about much at all. That has changed today (01.15.2021) as Traderain one of the head developers and creator of WolvenKit updated everyone one the Discord Server that he and rfuzzo have been in contact with CD Project Red and got the news about how much they are supporting our work and what we are doing and is actively now helping us. First step is by releasing a nearly completely list of game files, that would have taken additional month or even more, to brute force from the packed .archive files, as well as not being able to do due to unreleased stuff and how our tool works. ( We are certain the missing hashes we now need to actually complete our list are simple files that are unnecessary to create our tools as they are either ripped content or copy right stuff that they are now allowed to actively give us like that. ) Of course this won't be the end of our partnership with CDPR but that it for now all we can say.

All we can do now is being eager and continue creating tools and we would be happy to get more helping hand for coding! If you have experience and love to work with us, come join us on discord and talk with us about what we do, as well as talk a look at our GitHub Organisation with our main content. We are also welcoming those who want to help us in a different way, by either contributing to the Wiki at wiki.cybermods.net or elsewhere.

Until then cheers,Your CP77 Modding Tools team!
